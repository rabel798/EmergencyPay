Create a complete MVP for EmergencyPay, an offline payment system that works during UPI outages in India. The application should have the following components:

## Core Functionality
1. A Flutter mobile app with both merchant and customer interfaces
2. Offline transaction capability using Bluetooth Low Energy for device-to-device payments
3. SQLite3 database for local transaction storage and synchronization
4. Digital signature implementation for transaction verification without internet
5. Simulated reconciliation process when connectivity is restored

## Technical Requirements
1. Use Flutter for cross-platform mobile development
2. Implement SQLite3 for local database storage
3. Use the flutter_bluetooth_serial package for device communication
4. Implement ED25519 cryptography for lightweight digital signatures
5. Create a simple, intuitive UI that resembles familiar UPI apps

## Specific Features
1. User registration and wallet setup (simplified for MVP)
2. QR code generation and scanning for payment initiation
3. Bluetooth device discovery and pairing
4. Transaction signing and verification without internet
5. Local transaction history with pending/completed status
6. Mock reconciliation with a simulated central server
7. Emergency mode toggle that activates offline capabilities
8. Essential service merchant flagging (medical, food, transport)

## Database Schema
Design SQLite3 tables for:
1. Users (id, name, phone, public_key, private_key)
2. Transactions (id, sender_id, receiver_id, amount, timestamp, signature, status)
3. Merchants (id, name, category, is_essential_service)
4. Pending_sync (transaction_id, retry_count, last_attempt)

## UI Requirements
1. Clean, minimal interface with clear status indicators
2. Prominent display of offline/online status
3. Emergency mode activation button
4. Transaction history with clear pending/completed status
5. Simple merchant registration flow
6. QR code display and scanner

## Testing Scenarios
Include functionality to simulate:
1. Complete internet outage
2. UPI service outage with internet working
3. Delayed transaction settlement
4. Multiple device transaction propagation

Provide complete, working code with detailed comments explaining the implementation. The MVP should be demonstrable within a hackathon setting and clearly show how transactions can occur without internet connectivity.
